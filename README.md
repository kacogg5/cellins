# cellins

Cell-Ins are a type of logic puzzle like sudoku. Each puzzle is a grid scattered with digits 0-9. Each clue determines how many cells around it (counting the cell it is in as well) will be shaded in, no more no less. The end result will be an image. This project is an investigation of the puzzle and an implementation of the most efficient algorithm to 1) solve any puzzle and 2) revert an image to the least number of clues required for someone else to solve.
